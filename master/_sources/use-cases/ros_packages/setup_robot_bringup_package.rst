Setup robot bringup
==========================================
.. _uc-setup-robot-bringup:

This use-case describes how to set up a robot bringup package using scripts
from ROS Team Workspace (RosTeamWS) framework.
The package follows as far as possible best practices for
`robot support packages <http://wiki.ros.org/Industrial/Tutorials/WorkingWithRosIndustrialRobotSupportPackages>`_
from ROS-Industrial consortia. (**This has to be verified!**)


Script for Setting up a Bringup Package
============================================

``setup-robot-bringup`` script accepts the robot name and the robot description
package name. The package name is obtained from the 'package.xml' file.

  .. note:: It is recommended to setup your package using
    :ref:`setup-new-package <uc-new-package>` script.

  .. warning:: The script **has to be executed** in the root folder of the
    **ament_cmake** package where the robot bringup files are to be generated.

The scripts copies template files from the ``templates/robot_bringup`` folder,
renames the files, and replaces the placeholders.

.. code-block:: bash
