Installation of Docker
"""""""""""""""""""""""
.. _general-info-on-docker-installation:

You have to install docker which is dependent on the operating system you are using.

*   `Windows <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/>`_
*   `Mac <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/>`_
*   `Linux <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/>`_: it depends.

You can verify that you have docker successfully installed by running:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run hello-world

which should print out a "Hello from Docker!" message.

.. note::
  However make sure your user is in the docker group. Check with: ``groups`` command. To add your user to the docker group run: ``sudo usermod -aG docker $(whoami)``.
