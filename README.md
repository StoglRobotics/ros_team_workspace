# ros_team_workspace

Ros Team Workspace (RosTeamWS) is a framework for boosting collaboration in teams when developing software for robots using [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/).
It supports both **ROS1** and **ROS2**.
Its main goal is to optimize the workflow of development teams and focus more on programming robots.

## Purpose

This package targets the following stakeholders:

* **Robotic Companies** to have a unified, overview repository of their use-cases, enable across-teams re-use of ROS packages, and to define "standardized" development structure.
* **Robotic Consultants** to simplify ROS packages' management and provide open and documented package-structure for their customers.
* **R&D Departments** to propagate the packages across their development stages by keeping simple access and sharing policy.
* **Research Labs** to organize their work across research groups and reduce onboarding time for new students.


**The framework is the main entry-point for teams to**:

#. organize their public and private ROS packages;
#. describes scenarios;
#. enable continuous integration across the use-cases;
#. and provide scripts for easy use of ROS.


**To achieve this, RosTeamWS defines**:

#. an architecture of overlaid workspaces for sharing standard ROS packages;
#. standardized package structure for straightforward collaboration;
#. scripts for workspace and package management to keep their internal structure familiar to everyone in the team;
#. often-used scripts for tests of small development-chunks.


The framework is initiated by Denis Stogl (2017-2020) for increasing collaboration at the Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics (IAR) - Intelligent Process Control and Robotics (IPR) of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

From the 2021 the framework is maintained by Stogl Robotic Consulting.
