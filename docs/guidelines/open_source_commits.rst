Guidelines on contributing to open-source projects
=======================
.. _guidelines-development:

This documents proposes development guidelines on how to make contributions to open-source projects in a structured manner. 

**NOTE**: All the proposal here are the results of authors' personal experiences. Saying that, if you have any idea to make them better you are very welcome to create a PR.

Steps to follow
=========

1. Try and fix the changes locally in your own fork

2. Commit and push to your own feature branch

3. Go to the upstream branch(of the main project, not just the fork)

4. Create a new feature branch from the upstream branch

5. Apply your changes(using cherry-pick) using your own commit hash

6. Push to your own repository branch

7 Open a pull request on the upstream repository
