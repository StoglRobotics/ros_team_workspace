Guidelines on contributing to open-source projects
=======================
.. _guidelines-development:

This documents proposes development guidelines on how to make contributions to open-source projects in a structured manner. When you find a new issue or want to solve an existing issue in an open source project, you can perform the following steps to increase the chances of making your contribution useful and appreciated.

**NOTE**: All the proposal here are the results of authors' personal experiences. Saying that, if you have any idea to make them better you are very welcome to create a PR.

#. First, try and fix the changes locally in your own branch. Usually, you do this in a repository which is forked from the main open-source project.

#. Once you've found a good solution, commit and push to your own feature branch. Be aware that you only fix the relevant issue in this feature branch, don't make more changes than is necessary.

#. Go to the upstream branch of your forked repository, and create a new feature branch. 

#. In this feature branch, apply the changes you made in your previous branch with its commit hash(using cherry-pick) and push it.

#. Open a pull request on the upstream branch of the main repository for your feature branch. Make sure you adhere to the project's guidelines on how to write the pull request.
